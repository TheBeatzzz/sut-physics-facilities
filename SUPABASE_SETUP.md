# Supabase setup for the SUT Physics equipment platform

This site can run in two modes:

- Prototype mode: uses browser `localStorage`; no shared database.
- Supabase mode: uses faculty login, shared PostgreSQL tables, and Supabase Storage for equipment photos.

## 1. Create the Supabase project

1. Go to Supabase and create a new project.
2. Open **SQL Editor**.
3. Copy the full contents of [`supabase-schema.sql`](supabase-schema.sql) and run it.

The SQL creates:

- `registry_admins` approved-faculty allowlist table
- `facilities` table
- `equipment` table
- `equipment-photos` storage bucket
- Row Level Security policies

By default, edit access is limited to authenticated users who are both:

- using an email ending with `@sut.ac.th` or `@g.sut.ac.th`;
- listed as active in `registry_admins`.

## 2. Configure authentication

In Supabase, open **Authentication → Providers → Email**.

Recommended settings:

- Enable Email provider.
- Keep password sign-in enabled.
- Add the GitHub Pages admin URL to allowed redirect URLs for password recovery/invite flows:
  `https://thebeatzzz.github.io/sut-physics-equipment-platform/admin.html`

If your faculty use a different email domain, edit both the `registry_admins_sut_email` constraint and the `public.is_sut_editor()` function in `supabase-schema.sql` before running it, or update them in SQL Editor.

## 3. Add approved faculty admins

After running the schema, insert the first approved registry manager directly in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
insert into public.registry_admins (email, full_name, role, active)
values ('faculty.name@sut.ac.th', 'Faculty Name', 'admin', true)
on conflict (email) do update set
  full_name = excluded.full_name,
  role = excluded.role,
  active = excluded.active;
```

Add one row per approved faculty member. Only active emails in this table can manage equipment records.

Both regular SUT email and Google-hosted SUT email are accepted, for example:

```sql
insert into public.registry_admins (email, full_name, role, active)
values ('faculty.name@g.sut.ac.th', 'Faculty Name', 'faculty', true);
```

Once the first admin is added, approved admins can also manage this table from Supabase SQL Editor. Do not store this list or any service-role key in the GitHub Pages website.

## 4. Faculty passwords

Recommended workflow:

1. Add the faculty email to `registry_admins`.
2. In **Supabase → Authentication → Users**, create or invite the faculty user with an initial password or password-recovery email.
3. The faculty member signs in at `admin.html` with email and password.
4. After sign-in, they can use **Change password** in the admin toolbar to set their own password.

Do not distribute shared passwords. If you must create an initial password, ask the faculty member to change it immediately after first login. The website only lets the currently signed-in faculty member update their own Supabase password.

## 5. Add project credentials to the website

Open [`supabase-config.js`](supabase-config.js) and replace:

```js
url: "https://YOUR-PROJECT-REF.supabase.co",
anonKey: "YOUR-SUPABASE-ANON-KEY",
```

Use values from **Project Settings → API**:

- Project URL, for example `https://your-project-ref.supabase.co`
- anon public key

Use the base Project URL only. Do not paste the REST endpoint ending in `/rest/v1/`.

Do not put the service-role key in this website.

## 6. Seed example records

After publishing the config:

1. Open `admin.html`.
2. Sign in with a pre-approved SUT faculty email.
3. Go to **Data & export**.
4. Click **Seed examples**.

This adds the example Physics equipment and facility records to Supabase.

## 7. Public publishing workflow

The public page shows only equipment where:

- `reviewStatus` is `Verified`
- `publicReady` is checked

The admin page can see all records after sign-in.

## Security note

`admin.html` is still a public file on GitHub Pages. That is normal for a static site. The protection is in Supabase:

- anonymous visitors cannot read draft/internal equipment rows;
- anonymous visitors can read only facilities linked to approved public equipment;
- anonymous visitors cannot edit records;
- only authenticated, active, pre-approved `@sut.ac.th` or `@g.sut.ac.th` users in `registry_admins` can manage records and upload photos.

## Password login troubleshooting

If a faculty member cannot sign in:

1. Confirm the user exists in **Supabase → Authentication → Users**.
2. Confirm their email is active in `public.registry_admins`.
3. Confirm the email ends with `@sut.ac.th` or `@g.sut.ac.th`.
4. If the password is unknown, send a password recovery/invite email from Supabase Dashboard or create a temporary password and ask them to change it immediately.

The site can still complete Supabase invite/recovery callbacks, but normal registry login is password-first.
